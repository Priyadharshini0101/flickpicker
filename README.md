# MovieNight

This is a template for an application for Discord movie night that can be used
for a voting system. So that users can vote on through Discord, possibly Titch,
or through the app/website itself

## Technologies

This primarily uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The backend uses Express.
The UI library/framework is Bootstrap with FontAwesome via CDN on the index.html in the Frontend/client public directory

## Development

Best way to work on this at the moment is to install a live hot reload extension like in VSCode Five Server or Live Server and
open the index.html in Frontend/client/public.  It might work partially in nodejs/express, but there isn't any
app.js // App.js or index.js yet on either side.
